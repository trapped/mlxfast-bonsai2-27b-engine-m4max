/// Depend on a SIBLING `../mlx-swift` checkout when one exists, and on the
/// remote otherwise.
///
/// Track repos and Darkbloom both consume this fork BESIDE an mlx-swift
/// checkout of their own. With this package naming mlx-swift by URL and the
/// consumer naming the same package by path, SwiftPM sees two packages
/// claiming one identity and warns that the conflict "will be escalated to
/// an error" — and until it does, which of the two trees actually compiles
/// is a resolution detail rather than a decision. Pointing at the sibling
/// makes it a decision: one checkout, the one on disk next to this one.
///
/// The check is on `Package.swift` inside the sibling, not on the directory:
/// an empty or half-cloned `../mlx-swift` must fall back to the remote
/// rather than fail resolution with a confusing "not a package" error.
