// MLXRunners — the runner boundary (Darkbloom runner contract v0.2, §5/§6/§9).
//
// A runner is ONE model family behind the CBv2 engine, plus a static
// manifest describing what that family can do. Two consumers drive it and
// neither carries family-specific construction code:
//
//   * Darkbloom, in process, for serving;
//   * benchd, through the generic `bench-worker` executable, over Engine
//     Protocol v1.
//
// Policy stays with the CALLER. `EngineBuild` carries KV sizing, backend
// selection, scheduler/loop configuration, and the prefix cache; the runner
// supplies the model, its layer kinds, its per-layer caches, its
// capabilities, and its drafter. That split is what lets one runner serve a
// provider slot (SSD prefix cache, paged preflight, slot vetoes) and a
// benchmark worker (fixed contiguous, no cache, no queue) without either
// consumer knowing the family.
