// MLXRunners — Engine Protocol v1 server over `Runner`
// (Darkbloom runner contract §6.1, §8, §9).
//
// ONE server for every runner: benchd never links a runner, and this file
// carries no family name. Everything it advertises derives from the loaded
// runner's manifest plus what actually loaded; everything it reports is a
// counter the engine or the stepper already keeps.
//
// It NEVER emits a timing. benchd times the round trip; a worker that
// reported its own numbers would be scoring itself.
//
// WHY THIS IS A LIBRARY FILE while `Executables/bench-worker/main.swift` is
// a thin shim: a test target that depends on an executable target makes
// SwiftPM run that binary as the swift-testing host, which aborts the whole
// package's `@Test` pass — the reason `BenchCBv2Core`/`BenchCBv2` are split
// the same way (see Package.swift). The conformance test drives
// `BenchWorkerServer` in process over a mock runner.
