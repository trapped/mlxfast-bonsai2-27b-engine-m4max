// MLXRunners — the RESIDENT worker (contract §12f) and the attach path.
//
// The rule is David's, 2026-08-30: one weight load per measurement window.
// benchd starts a worker per PHASE — warmup, timed prefill, timed decode,
// correctness, twice per leg, once per cohort pair — so a worker that loads
// on startup loads a 113 GB checkpoint a dozen times for one window. The
// ranked pipeline has twenty minutes. It does not fit.
//
// So the weights get an owner. `bench-worker resident` is one process for
// one window: it validates argv, loads ONCE, and then listens on a Unix
// socket. Each phase's `bench-worker runtime-worker` attaches, speaks the
// whole Engine Protocol v1 session over that socket, and loads nothing.
//
// Modelled on the CUDA track's `ds4-resident`
// (cudafast-qwen38-125b-a6b-engine-dev: `harness/protocol-adapter/src/
// resident.rs`, `ds4_shim/ds4_resident.c`, `docs/ds4-resident.md`), with one
// deliberate difference. ds4 lets a second connection wait in the listen
// backlog; here it is REFUSED. A resident serving two attached workers
// stalls benchd's window, and a queued second phase looks like a slow engine
// rather than a double attach — the failure names itself this way.
//
// What is NOT changed by residency:
//
//   * phase isolation — the allocator is drained when a connection is
//     accepted, before the client's first byte, so a phase can never inherit
//     the one before it, and the per-phase drain still runs as today;
//   * the clock — the parent times the round trip, the worker still emits no
//     timing;
//   * the session — a fresh nonce per connection, hello first, and any error
//     discards that session exactly as in process.
//
// Identity on the wire: the attaching worker appends a `resident` object
// carrying the resident's pid and `load_epoch`, so an artifact can SHOW that
// every phase of a window ran against one load rather than assuming it.
//
// `backend` is NOT touched. It names the COMPUTE backend, and the
// conformance kit compares it to the manifest's own `backend` — an
// `mlx-resident` there is refused as "not the manifest backend mlx", which
// is correct: residency is a topology fact about WHERE the weights live, not
// a different way of computing. The ds4 precedent did label the backend,
// because it had no `resident` block to put the fact in; this one does.
//
// Environment:
//
//   BENCH_WORKER_RESIDENT_SOCKET   names the resident's socket; when set,
//                                  `runtime-worker` attaches instead of
//                                  serving in process. Absent, behaviour is
//                                  exactly as today.
//   BENCH_WORKER_RESIDENT_HELLO=1  emit the `resident` hello object. OFF by
//                                  default: benchd's envelope is closed, so
//                                  a benchd that does not yet admit the
//                                  field rejects the whole hello line. See
//                                  ``ResidentIdentity``.
//
// benchd side (bench-dev): `BENCH_WORKER_` joins the engine child
// environment allowlist beside `DS4_`, so the socket name reaches the
// spawned worker, and the closed envelope must admit `resident` before this
// ships.
